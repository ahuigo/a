China said on January 20th that there were signs of human transmission. Refer to [Timeline of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic from November 2019 to January 2020]

The reason for the late identification of human-to-human signals is:

1. A paper published in the Lancet indicates that many infected cases have no history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market.  https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30211-7/fulltext
2. The health authorities first adopted the South China Seafood Market as a necessary screening condition. One consequence of this is that many people with obvious symptoms do not meet this standard and are not treated in time and spread to more people. [最早认定华南海鲜市场是疫源地是否产生了误导]()
3. No one sells bats in the South China Seafood Market, and no traces of bats are found.
