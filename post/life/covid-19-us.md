# Covid US
# Why is social media starting to blame the U.S. for coronavirus rather than China?
There are some aspects of the outbreak that don’t add up, so questions are being raised, such as:

The CDC had meetings about disease outbreaks in the second half of last year. The minutes of these meetings are classified information, so no one knows what was discussed.
Trump fired people who raised the alarm early.
The USA raised concerns in the second half of 2019 about e cigarettes causing white lung disease, whereas these products are used globally and no one else has reported this finding. Corona virus produces similar symptoms. Update. Apparently Australia has but I’m still unaware of other countries.
There are more strains of COVID-19 in the USA than anywhere else.
The first case in China was November 17, three weeks after the military games had ended. Participants from the USA were encouraged to sightsee rather than put much effort into the games. These were held in Wuhan.
The CDC has said that some death attributed to flu were actually COVID-19.
All the scientists have been careful to say that COVID-19 was first discovered in China, but are not saying that was the origin.
Nature magazine concludes that whilst the virus may have originated in Pangolins, it might also have been passaged it humans and become more virulent that way.

It’s all conjecture, but as Pompeo says about the USA ‘We lied, we cheated we stole.’ The USA has a long history of dirty tricks and dabbling with spreading disease, so it has form. In the same way that if someone is poisoned with something radioactive, you think of Russia, if people start getting weird diseases, you think of the USA.
