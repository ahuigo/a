Till this very day, the US government and many in the journalism industry haven’t learned the lesson.

In face of an epidemic, let scientists, and epidemiologists answer the questions, devise plans, and predict outcomes. All others should step aside. There is no political, racial, ideological or religious room for interpretations of a virus because a virus only recognizes molecular receptors regardless all else above.

Politicians should do what they can to enforce recommendations from experts, and journalists should do what they can to combat misinformation. At least, that’s what China did.

WHO after investigation said China’s numbers were reliable. Head of Canadian CDC said the numbers in China were correct. Most of scientists in the world, including those at Lancet trust China’s numbers.

China was the first country to report on a daily basis of the statistics of covid19. If the infection rate and fatality rate obtained from these numbers, and the curves set by China can be corroborated by other countries’ statistics set afterwards, then China’s numbers have scientific grounds.

Chinese scientists have been constantly updating their research results of covid19, publish them on papers and share them to the world. But these scientists in China can only do so much to share it to other scientists through science journals and WHO. Whether their findings are relayed to the public of other countries is out of China’s scope of responsibilities.

The world is properly warned. Whether you heed it or not depends on your government and media’s willingness to follow scientific advice which should not be given by intelligence communities, nor politicians, nor journalists.

MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow has done a good job interviewing experts about the how they view the epidemics. And CNN is doing fact checking of White House coronavirus briefings. These are all commendable efforts. But not enough.

Still, instead of listening to and believing what scientists have to say, many people would rather tune in to some citizen journalists and reports of dubious sources. Any rumor that might prove that China is lying feed their cravings for lunacy. Like the rumor that China’s telecom has lost millions of subscriptions hence millions in China are suspected to have died. Thousands of more urns appeared in Wuhan than previously reported covid19 related death count.

In a conversation with my wife, I told her of these rumors circulating in the western media as proofs that China was under reporting numbers, she bursted into laughter immediately and asked as if people actually believe that. I told her yes, as a matter of fact, millions do.

The internet follows mob psychology, especially in times of crisis and disasters. This is why every time there is a disaster in China, rumors abound. And every time, Chinese social media platforms unite to fight against misinformation. But not so much in the US.

There are some anti misinformation mechanisms led by google and twitter. But when the White House and major news outlets in the US are leading the charge to spread misinformation, there is little you can do about it.

The Trump administration is blaming everyone but themselves. They blame China, blame CDC, blame blue state governors, blame Obama. Only China doesn’t have a domestic voice to defend itself. So China is the easy target.

The intelligence community shouldn’t be doing this job. CDC staffs should be doing it. But Trump slashed its China office. Oops!

So again, US intelligence community stepped up just like when they were finding WMDs in Iraq. Last time, Collin Powell waved a magic bottle of Tide as proofs of the existence of WMD in Iraq. This time, it’s a quote from an unnamed source revealing the gist of a classified report unable to be disclosed to the public. And people buy it.

What a crazy world we live in today.
# China daily
- China is only the first country to detect the virus. If the first country which detect and report the virus should responsible for it, then no country will report the virus.

China warned the world immediately when they realized it, and has been updating the information.

December 27 - Dr. Zhang Jixian reported these cases to hospital leadership.

December 29 - After joint diagnosis, the hospital reported the disease to Wuhan CDC.

December 31 - China reported the unknown disease to WHO. Is that what you mean by “withholding information”?

January 3 - China reported the disease to other countries including the United States. Is that how someone “withhold information”?

January 5 - China isolated the strain, and identified 59 cases. On the same day, WHO released the news.

January 20 - Dr. Zhong NanShan said they found evidence of human-to-human transmission

Human-to-human infections verified take a long time to prove. At that time, the Chinese medical team set the standard so high that no human-to-human transmission was found.

This standard contains 3 items, and detection must pass all the these 3 item.

1. Been to the seafood market.

2, whole gene sequence detection.

3. Fever.

In order to avoid the outbreak of immunization, the Chinese government acted immediately.

January 23 China begin to implement Lock-Down Wuhan, which is considered by the West to be without human rights.


The WHO praised the Chinese government's action, some people are wasting precious time China has earned for the world
