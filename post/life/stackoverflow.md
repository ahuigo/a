# stackoverflow readline
Suggest: do not capture `ctrl+f/b/k` keyboard event of Mac OSX when visiting stackoverflow website.

On Mac OSX, these shortcuts `ctrl+b` , `ctrl+k` are belong to Mac's readline shortuct: https://jblevins.org/log/kbd


Since stackoverflow has used `command+b/k` as shortcut for editing. **There is no need to take up the shortcut keys of mac system.**

I recommend the following shortcuts for Mac OSX users:

1. **Ctrl+B**       Move Cursor Backwards
2. **Command+B**    Bold Text
3. **Ctrl+K**       Delete Text Forwards Line
4. **Command+k**    Code Sample
