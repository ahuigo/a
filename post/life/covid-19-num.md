# China's num of injected cases
What do you think about the claim that China has vastly understated the spread of the coronavirus and the damage the pandemic has done?
The USA just ordered 100,000 
body bags. Does that mean 100,000 people have died?

The New York Times cannot be trusted to post anything even remotely unbiased regarding China. I hope people realize that. I’d consume it if I could (paywall) as I like to get all the opinions I can, but you should realize that it is, inherently, an anti-China publication.

The phone thing
?

“It was mainly due to reduced business and social activities resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak,” a spokesperson with the company confirmed to the AP. “Many customers in China have multiple SIM cards and it is common that they use their non-primary SIM cards to do these activities.”

This is true. There are more cell phones than PEOPLE in China! Many people use them for work, and work only. They have a private, personal SIM card, and a work one.

At one point, I had THREE PHONES. (Personal, work 1, work 2)

Do they really think that TWENTY ONE MILLION PEOPLE are dead?

Further reading.

“Expert analysts believe that the drop in the mobile users could partly be responsible for the number of migrant workers who cancelled their work region mobile subscriptions as the virus prevented them from entering the country after the lunar holidays in China.

The migrant workers usually have one subscription for their work location and another subscription for their home region. “

Please just think. Think about how absurd that is.

One chart makes me think that China has been honest.


On Feb 12th, new cases EXPLODED. Why?

They changed from counting by test result, to using a diagnostic, symptom based one.

They didn’t have to do that!

Really. They didn’t. It’s clear China doesn’t give a f*ck about what the world really thinks of it — see their actions in the South China Sea and dismissal of international arbitration committees decisions.

But they did, in full awareness that it would lead to far higher numbers.

Sweden
 has taken a very lax approach. They are not counting many deaths that probably should be counted.

Diabetes+COVID-19+Death=Diabetes as cause of death.

USA?

Went the other way.

“COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death,”

Every country is going to count cases and deaths slightly differently.

Is Sweden lying? The USA?

Every country is going to test differently: for example, Luxembourg has 1,000 times as many tests per capita as Indonesia.


Similar case numbers, different reality. Is either “lying”?


People don’t realize how early things were shut down: fewer than 300 cases per day and Wuhan was in lockdown. A day later all of Hubei. Yea, the local government f*cked this up, but after that, swift action.

Besides, how exactly are they going to hide all of these bodies? Thousands of foreigners live in the area, as well as millions of locals, not all of whom are blind fanbois of the CCP. You’d think there would be some stronger evidence than some phone numbers.

Ultimately, we just don’t know.

But I don’t think any real evidence has been presented that shows the death count is much higher than reported, and if you believe that evidence, you are probably biased and not thinking logically or fairly.
